# SDR ( Software - Defined Radio)
It refers to a device that you can plug an antenna into and receive RF signals , with the digitalized RF samples being sent to a computer for processing or recording .many SDR also have transmit capabilities .
# DSP (Digital Signal Processing)
It refers to various techniques for improving the accuracy and reliability of digital communications.
# Frequency domain 
The frequency domain refers to an analysis or representation of data, signals, or functions in terms of frequency rather than time. This concept is crucial in many fields, including signal processing, image processing, and communications.
# Fourier Series
When we break signal down into it's composite sine waves,we call it a Fourier series. 
To understand how we can break down a signal into sine waves,we need to know about:
1.Amplitude: strength of wave
2.Frequency: no.of waves per second.
3.Phase:phase representation how the sine wave is shifted in time , anywhere from 0 to 360 degrees.
